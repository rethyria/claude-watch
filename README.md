```

## What It Does

- **Live terminal output** on your Apple Watch — see what Claude is doing in real-time
- **Permission prompts** — approve or deny Claude's actions from your wrist (Edit file? Run command?)
- **Dynamic questions** — answer `AskUserQuestion` prompts with all options displayed
- **Voice commands** — dictate commands to Claude via watchOS dictation
- **iPhone companion** — pairing UI, connection status, terminal preview, permission approvals
- **Bridge server** — Node.js server on your Mac that connects Claude Code to the watch via HTTP hooks + SSE

## Architecture

The system has three components:

### 1. Bridge Server (Mac)
A Node.js HTTP server (`skill/bridge/server.js`) that:
- Receives events from Claude Code via [HTTP hooks](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) (`PostToolUse`, `PermissionRequest`, `Stop`, etc.)
- Streams events to connected clients via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Handles pairing with a 6-digit code + session token
- Advertises itself on the local network via Bonjour/mDNS
- Blocks on `PermissionRequest` hooks — waits for watch/phone approval, then returns the decision to Claude Code

### 2. iPhone App
A SwiftUI iOS app that:
- Discovers the bridge via Bonjour (or localhost fallback)
- Pairs using the 6-digit code
- Shows connection status + terminal output
- Displays interactive permission prompts (Yes / Yes all / No)
- Relays events to the Apple Watch via WCSession

### 3. watchOS App
A SwiftUI watchOS app that:
- Connects directly to the bridge over Wi-Fi (Bonjour or manual IP entry)
- Shows live terminal output (Read, Edit, Bash, Grep operations)
- Displays permission prompts with all options as scrollable buttons
- Supports voice command input via watchOS dictation
- Haptic feedback for task completion, approvals, and errors

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- macOS with Node.js 18+
- Xcode 16+ with watchOS SDK
- Apple Watch on the same Wi-Fi as your Mac
- Claude Code CLI installed

### Apple Watch Wi-Fi Setup
1. Make sure your Apple Watch is connected to the **same Wi-Fi network** as the Mac running your Claude Code session
2. On your Apple Watch, go to **Settings > Wi-Fi > your network** and turn **Private Wi-Fi Address** to **Off** — this is required for Bonjour/mDNS discovery to work reliably on the local network

### 1. Install the bridge

```bash
cd skill/bridge
npm install
```

### 2. Start the bridge server

```bash
cd skill/bridge
node server.js
```

You'll see:
```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════╗
║        AGENT WATCH BRIDGE             ║
╠═══════════════════════════════════════╣
║  Pairing Code:  648505                ║
║  IP Address:    192.168.1.4           ║
║  Port:          7860                  ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════╝
```

Start the bridge **before** installing hooks: if the default port 7860 is
taken (Gradio's default, notably), the bridge binds the next free port and
publishes it to `~/.claude-watch/port` — the hook installer reads that file
to write correct hook URLs.

### 3. Install Claude Code hooks

This configures all Claude Code sessions to stream events to the bridge:

```bash
./skill/setup-hooks.sh
```

If you run it before the bridge has ever started, it falls back to port 7860
and warns loudly — re-run it once the bridge is up so the hook URLs match the
bridge's actual port.

To remove hooks later: `./skill/setup-hooks.sh --remove`

### 4. Build the iOS + watchOS apps

```bash
cd ios/ClaudeWatch
xcodegen generate    # Generates the .xcodeproj
open ClaudeWatch.xcodeproj
```

In Xcode:
1. Set your **Development Team** on both targets (ClaudeWatch + ClaudeWatchWatch)
2. Select the **ClaudeWatch** scheme for the iPhone, or **ClaudeWatchWatch** for the watch
3. Build and run (Cmd+R)

### 5. Pair

**iPhone:** Enter the 6-digit pairing code from the bridge banner.

**Apple Watch:** The app auto-discovers the bridge via Bonjour. If that fails, enter the IP address shown in the bridge banner manually.

**Discovery probe:** When a watch client verifies a candidate bridge address — the localhost fallback, a manually entered IP, or `10.0.2.2` from an Android emulator — it probes the unauthenticated `GET /ping` endpoint, which answers with `{proto, bridgeId, machineName}`. `GET /status` requires the paired device's bearer token and cannot be used for discovery.

### 6. Use Claude Code normally

Start any Claude Code session in a terminal. Every tool use (Read, Edit, Bash, Grep) streams to the watch and phone in real-time. Permission prompts appear as interactive cards.

## How It Works

### Event Flow (Mac -> Watch)

1. Claude Code runs a tool (e.g., Edit a file)
2. The `PostToolUse` HTTP hook fires, POSTing to the bridge server
3. Bridge pushes the event to all connected SSE clients
4. The watch/phone receives the SSE event and renders it as a terminal line

### Permission Flow (Mac -> Watch -> Mac)

1. Claude Code hits a permission prompt (e.g., "Do you want to edit this file?")
2. The `PermissionRequest` HTTP hook fires — bridge **blocks** the response
3. Bridge pushes a `permission-request` SSE event with the question + options
4. Watch shows the approval sheet with all options as tappable buttons
5. User taps an option — watch sends the decision back to the bridge via HTTP
6. Bridge returns the decision to Claude Code's hook — Claude continues or stops

### AskUserQuestion Flow

Same as permission flow, but the hook data includes `tool_input.questions` with dynamic options (label + description). The watch renders these as a scrollable list matching the terminal's numbered choices.

## Claude Code Hooks

The `setup-hooks.sh` script installs these HTTP hooks globally in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

| Hook Event | Purpose | Blocking? |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| `PostToolUse` | Capture tool output (file reads, edits, commands) | No (async) |
| `PreToolUse` | Capture tool invocations | No (async) |
| `PermissionRequest` | Forward permission prompts to watch | **Yes** (up to 10 min) |
| `Stop` | Detect when Claude finishes responding | No (async) |
| `PostToolUseFailure` | Capture errors | No (async) |
| `StopFailure` | Capture API errors | No (async) |
| `Notification` | Idle/permission notifications | No (async) |

## Configuration

### Bridge Server

| Env Var | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | 7860 | Starting port (tries 7860-7869) |

### Removing Hooks

```bash
./skill/setup-hooks.sh --remove
```

Removal (and reinstall dedup) matches individual hook objects by exact URL —
`http://127.0.0.1:<port>` plus one of the installer's own `/hooks/<path>`
endpoints — so your own hooks are never touched, even ones on other loopback
ports/paths or sharing a settings entry with claude-watch's. All settings.json
rewrites go through a temp file + rename, so an interrupted run can't corrupt
the file.

### Unpairing

- **iPhone:** Settings > Forget Mac
- **Watch:** Restart the app (credentials clear when bridge restarts)

## Requirements

| Component | Minimum Version |
|-----------|----------------|
| macOS | 13.0+ |
| Node.js | 18+ |
| Xcode | 16+ |
| iOS | 17.0 |
| watchOS | 10.0 |
| Claude Code | 2.1+ |

## Troubleshooting

### Watch shows "Bridge not found"
- Ensure `node server.js` is running on your Mac
- Check that your watch is on the same Wi-Fi network
- Use the "Enter IP manually" option with the IP shown in the bridge banner

### Watch shows "unsupported architecture"
- Clean build folder in Xcode (Cmd+Shift+Option+K)
- Select the correct scheme: **ClaudeWatchWatch** (not ClaudeWatch)
- Deploy via paired iPhone destination if direct watch deployment fails

### iPhone shows "Connection failed"
- Check that the bridge is running (`curl http://127.0.0.1:7860/ping`)
- The bridge must be on the same LAN as the iPhone

### Permission prompts don't appear on watch
- Verify hooks are installed: check `~/.claude/settings.json` for hook entries
- Check bridge logs for "Hook: PermissionRequest received"
- Ensure the watch is connected to the bridge (green status dot)

### Bridge exits immediately
- The bridge no longer auto-spawns Claude. It waits for events from hooks.
- Start Claude Code in a separate terminal — hooks will forward events automatically.
